# Weekly Journal

## Week 1-2: Make a Thing!

### overview
My first assignment was to create something using a game engine. I missed the first day of class due to some family business outside of Canada. I got back during the second week, so I went through the slides and course outline to see what I needed to do for the second class.

### process
For this assignment, I decided to use the Bitsy tool to create a simple game. Since I was in Houston visiting my family, food was a big part of my day, especially since they are known for making some of the best BBQ. When I got back, it was still stuck in my mind. So for the game I created, I wanted to make something that revolves around Houston and food.

Bitsy is a very easy tool to work with, but sometimes I encountered bugs that I just couldn’t get around, which made me rethink and rebuild the gameplay—sort of building around the issues instead of eliminating them, since I couldn’t find a solution. One of the issues was that when adding more than two sprites, the game would bug out and give me a blue screen with white lines. I couldn’t do anything except restart from the beginning, and this happened so often that it took me much longer than expected.

Another problem I encountered was with the “item” sprite. I wanted to be able to pick up the item and bring it to a tile that would end the game, but I couldn’t figure out how to program it. I’m sure that if I had more time, I would have been able to find a solution.

All in all, it was an enjoyable experience creating the map, sprites, and animation. I went with a yellow and black color palette to simplify the visuals and help players distinguish the road from the buildings.

## Week 2-3

### overview

For this week, we started Unity and created are first project. I downloaded rider to facilitate my journey with Unity (or so I was told). I had a fee issues with guthub and connecting my github with Unity but figured it out quickly. There wasn't anything due next class but the teacher mentionned playing around with the Unity to familiarise ourselves with the engine.

### impression
My first time using Unity was easy going. I knew it was complex but it wasn't as confusing as i thought it would be. Creating sprites and coding them on rider was easy to understand. 

## Week 3-4

### Overview

This week we dove deeper into the mechanism and functions of the _Catch em all_ game. Learned how to add textboxes and a point system that would react to the game and update the scoreboard at the top of the screen. We also went over the triangle of prototyping which consists of role, look and feel, and implementation. _Catch Em ALl_ wasn't the only game we did, towards the end of the class we also went over a pong game. The teacher went through the game, explaining each line of codes but we didn't build it from scratch like the first game.

Although _Catch Em All_ was a simple game, it still holds a level of complexity that I haven't gotten used to yet. Same goes for the pong game. i think the main issue is the overlay and menus, that I am not comfrotable with yet. I'm not too worried since this is normal and goes for any other programs when you start learning.

### Prototype ideas

The teacher asked us to come up with an idea simple or complex to add or change in the Pong game that we just checked out. I immediately had an idea, _**Blind Pong**_ and the core idea is to make the paddles become invisible after 3-5 seconds of gameplay. I think this would be in the Feel/Role category. This change would play with the player's focus, tensions as well as predictions and timing since the a visual information is removed, the player would need to rely on their spatial memory. This change does not completely strip the game of its identity but explores more of the player psychology. How would a player react and perform if a major piece of visual information is removed during gameplay? That's the main question of this prototype. To put this prototype from paper to unity is something I haven't tried yet. But I do have some ideas such as adding a fade in and out for the paddles, and a sound cue whenever the ball hits the invisible paddle to give the player an audio feedback. This would confirm a hit as well as giving players a small dopamine reward. This keeps the game satisfying while making players track success through sound instead of sight.
